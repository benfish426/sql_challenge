Code for the this assignment was modeled similar to examples from class files we completed. First, tables were created using PG Admin 4. Once the tables were generated, I imported 6 different CSV files to fill in the tables and began the data engineering component of this project. Once that was completed, I began the data analysis component. In my query statements, I used alias-ing and solved each of the following prompts:

List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name)

The last part of this assignment was completed on https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/ to create an ERD Diagram
